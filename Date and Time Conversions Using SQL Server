Problem
There are many instances when dates and times don't show up at your doorstep in the format you'd like it to be, 
nor does the output of a query fit the needs of the people viewing it. 
One option is to format the data in the application itself. 
Another option is to use the built-in functions SQL Server provides to format the date string for you.

Solution
SQL Server provides a number of options you can use to format a date/time string. One of the first considerations is the actual date/time needed.
 The most common is the current date/time using getdate(). 
 This provides the current date and time according to the server providing the date and time. If a universal date/time is needed, 
 then getutcdate() should be used. To change the format of the date,  you convert the requested date to a string and specify the format number corresponding to the format needed.
 DECLARE @counter INT = 0
DECLARE @date DATETIME = '2006-12-30 00:38:54.840'

CREATE TABLE #dateFormats (dateFormatOption int, dateOutput nvarchar(40))

WHILE (@counter <= 150 )
BEGIN
   BEGIN TRY
      INSERT INTO #dateFormats
      SELECT CONVERT(nvarchar, @counter), CONVERT(nvarchar,@date, @counter) 
      SET @counter = @counter + 1
   END TRY
   BEGIN CATCH;
      SET @counter = @counter + 1
      IF @counter >= 150
      BEGIN
         BREAK
      END
   END CATCH
END

SELECT * FROM #dateFormats


select replace(convert(varchar, getdate(),101),'/','')   														------>12302006
select replace(convert(varchar, getdate(),101),'/','') + replace(convert(varchar, getdate(),108),':','')		------>12302006004426
